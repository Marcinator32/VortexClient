/**
 * Hold a key, zoom with the wheel.
 *
 * Works the way a scope does: hold the key and the view pulls in, turn the
 * wheel to choose how far, let go and it eases back. The hotbar stays put
 * while zooming, because reaching for the wheel to aim and ending up with a
 * different item in hand is the last thing anyone wants mid-fight.
 *
 * The movement is smoothed rather than snapped. A hard jump between fields of
 * view is disorienting and makes it hard to keep track of what you were
 * looking at; easing into it keeps the picture readable the whole way.
