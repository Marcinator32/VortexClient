/**
 * Which of the two marks to show.
 *
 * Blue is the client on its own; red means the Vortex Plus addon is installed.
 * The point is that you can see at a glance which of the two you are running --
 * they behave rather differently, and finding that out the hard way on a server
 * is not the moment for the discovery.
 *
 * The mark in the menu is drawn from code rather than from an image: drawing a
 * texture needs a render pipeline argument in this version, which is one more
 * thing to get wrong for a shape that is two circles. The images are used where
 * they belong -- in the mod list, one per mod.
 *
 * Checked once and remembered. Mods cannot appear or disappear while the game
 * is running, so asking again every frame would be work for nothing.
