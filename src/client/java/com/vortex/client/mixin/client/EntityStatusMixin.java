/**
 * Counts totem pops, hooked at the packet handler.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT ON THE ENTITY:
 * The two earlier attempts hooked handleStatus — first on Entity, then on
 * LivingEntity as well. Neither fired. Checking the mappings shows why: only
 * Entity declares that method at all, and the totem case never reaches it,
 * because whatever handles it in between does not pass it on.
 *
 * The packet handler sits before all of that. Every entity status the server
 * sends arrives here first, so the count cannot be missed. The packet already
 * carries both pieces we need: which entity, and which event.
 *
 * Nothing is requested and nothing is sent — this event reaches every client
 * nearby anyway, so the totem animation can play.
